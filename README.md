 # Python Challenge - Py Me Up, Charlie

## The Challenge
Using two large data sets `PyBank` and `PyPoll`, create a script that summarizes the data and exports the results to a .txt file. 

- Imported data from `.csv` files
- Iterated through the data
- Calculated statics such as: sum, mean, max, min
- Created a `.txt` file that contains a summary of the findings

## File Directory:

  * A file called `main.py` contains the main script to run for each analysis.
  * A "Resources" folder that contains the CSV files used. 
  * An "analysis" folder that contains a `.txt` file that has the results from the analysis.
